    <p><b>Foreign direct investment (FDI)</b> in Nepal has declined by nearly 70 percent over the past six years, casting a shadow over the countryâ€™s ambitions to graduate to middle-income status by next year. </p>
    <p>According to the World Investment Report 2025: International Investment in the Digital Economy, released by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) last Thursday, Nepalâ€™s FDI inflow dropped to $57 million in 2024, down from $185 million in 2019â€”a sharp fall of 69.18 percent.</p>
    <p>The decline reflects a broader regional trend. South Asiaâ€™s total FDI inflow shrank to $34.56 billion in 2024 from $58 billion in 2019. India, the regionâ€™s largest economy, saw its FDI drop to $27.55 billion from $50.55 billion during the same period. Bangladesh and the Maldives also registered declines, while Afghanistan reported zero inflows. </p>
    <p>However, there were exceptions. Bhutan recorded a surge in FDI, getting $100 million in 2024 compared to just $3 million in 2019. Pakistan and Sri Lanka also saw an increase in foreign investment.</p>
    <p>Despite the recent drop in annual inflows, Nepal's total FDI stockâ€”the cumulative value of foreign investmentsâ€”rose to $8.28 billion in 2024, up from just $72 million in 2000.</p>
    <p>Without translating policies into real-world action, the country risks missing out on the potential benefits of digital growth. </p>
